# About Sportion

Sportion is a tool for tracking variating sport related performances. 

In Sportion the user can select a Outdoor Activity which tracks the user's location with Google Play API and displays the route on map and uses MPAndroidChart to display the speed of the travelled route. 

The user can also track Deadlift and Squat lifts and evaluate the RPE of those lifts to use as a diary to follow one's progress. In these lifts the phone uses it's accelerometer sensor to provide the user with data of the lifts to help with evaluating the RPE.
